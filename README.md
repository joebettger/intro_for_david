# Intro for David H

## Welcome! This is Markdown

Hey David, this is a file called `README.md` that you can find in almost any widely used piece of software on the planet. By convention, if you name a file `README.md`, especially if it is at the root of a project, it will show up in any version control piece of software. You use a `README.md` to take notes for yourself and to communicate things to other developers. 

In general, a `README.md` doc uses a syntax called `markdown` which is very easy to learn the basics of, and you rarely need anything more than the basics. Here's a [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Next Steps

_Before we move onto to learning a few things, there's some logistics to work out_

* Create a Github account and email/text it to me
* Make sure Git is installed on your computer (I got this started the other day)
  * You will probably need to do a bit of configuring it on your pc. See [guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
    * ```
      $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
      $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    ```sh
