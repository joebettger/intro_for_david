# Intro for David H

## Welcome! This is Markdown

Hey David, this is a file called `README.md` that you can find in almost any widely used piece of software no the planet. By convention, if you name a file `README.md`, especially if it is at the root of a project, it will show up in any version control piece of software. You use a `README.md` to take notes for yourself and to communicate things to other developers. 

In general, a `README.md` doc used a syntax called `markdown` which is very easy to learn the basics of, and you rarely need anything more than the basics. Here's a [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
